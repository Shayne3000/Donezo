# Donezo

A triage of building production-ready, cross-platform apps on Android & iOS devices using Kotlin Multiplatform. It employs the following multiplatform technologies and paradigms:

- Compose Multiplatform for UI,
- Navigation-Compose for navigation,
- [Shimmer](https://github.com/valentinilk/compose-shimmer) for constructing UI loading placeholders,
- [Compose Multiplatorm ScalableDp/Sp](https://github.com/Chaintech-Network/sdp-ssp-compose-multiplatform) for dimension scaling based on screen density,
- Coil for image loading,
- Koin for Dependency Injection,
- Kotlin Serialization for JSON parsing,
- Ktor for networking,
- Room for local persistence,
- Kotlin Date/Time for date and time management.
- Kotlin Coroutines for Concurrency,
- Kotlin Flows for observable data streams, and
- A layered architectural paradigm.
